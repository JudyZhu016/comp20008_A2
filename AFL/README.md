# Introduction of intended use for code and csv data files:
The code and CSV data files in this project are intended conducting dataset analysis.  By running the provided code, you will be able to load and explore the dataset, perform statistical analysis, visualize the data
# File Structure:
The project contains the following files:

- 'AFL-2022.csv': This CSV file contains the dataset that will be analyzed. 
- 'part1.py': This Python script contains the code for loading the dataset, performing analysis tasks, and generating insights. It utilizes  libraries Pandas.
- 'EDA.ipynb':  This notebook file contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the dataset.  It explores the data, performs data cleaning
- 'AFL_1.ipynb': This notebook file focuses on the first phase of the AFL (Analysis for Learning) process.  It includes correlation analysis, linear regression model creation, model performance evaluation and visualization.
- 'AFL_2.ipynb': This notebook file focuses on the second phase of the AFL (Analysis for Learning) process. It includes KNN model creation, model performance evaluation.

# Instructions on how to run your code:
Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently to reproduce the analysis and results.

# Any additional requirements needed to run code:
#To run the notebooks, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
